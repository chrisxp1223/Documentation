# ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive collection of debugging tips for AMD client firmware. It is intended for firmware and BIOS engineers working on system bring-up, issue triage, feature enablement, and root cause analysis across AMD platforms.

All tips included in this document are compiled from real-world scenarios observed during internal validation and customer support engagements.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

The main goals of this document are:

- To provide a centralized reference for firmware-level debugging techniques.
- To assist engineers in narrowing down system-level issues by disabling/enabling specific firmware features.
- To document best practices for using AMD and third-party debug tools.
- To summarize typical platform behaviors, log interpretations, and mitigation patches.

---

## ðŸ§­ Scope

This guide covers the following categories:

- **System Firmware Bring-up Tips**  
  Steps and references for initial BIOS and EC validation.

- **Feature Enablement Tips**  
  Security, performance, and power features and how to enable/verify them.

- **Debug Tool Usage**  
  Overview of internal tools like UDC, BIOSDBG, aHDT, WinDbg, and more.

- **System Debug & Log Analysis**  
  Techniques for interpreting logs, postcodes, and trace data during failures.

- **Platform-Specific Patches**  
  Temporary firmware modifications to isolate root causes (e.g., disabling WDT, Sync Flood, IOMMU, etc.)
